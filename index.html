             <h1>Early Carrer</h1>
             <p>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[32] Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 
                    class 12th in school, had played only school cricket and club cricket and no professional cricket. 
                    <br>
                    One of the famous episodes, when 
                     Dhoni used to play for CCL, was when Deval Sahay used to gift him Rs 50 for each six that he hit in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket 
                    matches. Playing for CCL, he got a chance to bat up the order.
                    <br>
                     He grabbed the opportunity and scored centuries and helped CCL
                     move to the A division.[34] Deval Sahay impressed by his hard-hitting shots and dedication, used his contacts in Bihar Cricket 
                     Association to push for his selection in the Bihar team.
                     <br>
                      Deval Sahay, an ex Bihar Cricket Association Vice-President, was the 
                     Ranchi District Cricket President at that time and was instrumental in pushing Dhoni to the big stage of Ranchi team, junior Bihar
                      cricket team and eventually senior Bihar Ranji Team for the 1999–2000 season.
                      <br>
                    Within 1 year, Dhoni moved from playing in CCL to
                     the Bihar Ranji team.[36][37] Dhoni has credited Deval Sahay for instilling discipline in him.[38] Dhoni was included in the 
                     Bihar U-19 squad for the 1998–99 season and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings) as the team finished fourth in the group of 
                     six and did not make it to the quarter-finals.
                    <br>
                            Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of 
                           India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). 
                           <br>Bihar U-19 cricket team advanced to the finals of 1999–2000 Cooch Behar 
                           Trophy, where Dhoni made 84 to help Bihar post a total of 357.
                           <br>Bihar's efforts were dwarfed by Punjab U-19s' 839 with Dhoni's 
                           future national squad teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358. Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 
                           12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.
                           <br> Dhoni made it to th Ne East Zone U-19 squad for the CKIn 1998, Dhoni was 
                           selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.
